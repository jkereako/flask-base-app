    Public templates
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The public templates module.

    Although this directory is not necessary, especially if your application
    does not have any restricted content, it does make it easier to find files
    while developing..

    More over, this particular file, __init__.py, does not need to be here. But,
    if for whatever reason you need to reference it in code, you can do so by:

    app.templates.public

    As such, I like to put __init__.py in every directory I create.
